# Device-Query-Test-CUDA
Device query test: 

To display how many GPUs can be used for CUDA computation and many useful properties about functional capabilities. There is a program called CUDA-Z in Windows, which is based on this device query example.
1. Initialize of CUDA.
2. Use CUDA to perform operations.
3. Calculate execution time.
4. Calculate the average and standard deviation of one million pieces of data.
